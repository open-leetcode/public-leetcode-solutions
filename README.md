## Repository Structure
* In the root directory you will find a separate directory for each programming language.
* In the directory for a programming language you will find the solutions under `solutions`
* For each solution there is a corresponding test in the `tests` directory

<br />

## Workflow
You can change any solution and then `Build` and `Run` it as explained below. You can also change the test values for each solution in its corresponding `tests` file.

<br />

## Build 
Build the codebase to apply your code changes.
```
yarn build
``` 

<br />

## Watch (continues build)
In watch mode your code changes are applied automatically in real-time so you won't need to run `yarn build` after each code change.
```
yarn watch
``` 

## Run
Run the test for a given solution e.g. if you want to run `1-add-numbers` you do:
```
yarn run test 2-add-numbers
```

# Contribute
